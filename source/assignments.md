### Participation

Your most basic assignment is to come to class prepared. Prepare for
class by going over the assigned reading for class with a text editor
and terminal open, doing your best to get the code to work. You are not
expected to come to class having mastered the topic, but you are
expected to have tried your hand at it.

By noon on the day of class, please send a brief e-mail to the course
list about at least one thing you think you learned and one thing you
want to see better explained. I will use your e-mails to tailor my
explanations in class.

### Weekly coding projects

For many classes I will ask you to work on a historical programming
problem. Your solutions should be published as a GitHub repository or
Gist before the start of class. You should come to class prepared to
talk about how you worked through the problem and (where appropriate)
what historical argument might be made from your findings. These 
projects will be evaluated on the basis of effort and imagination in 
applying programming to history.

### Tutorial

At our first meeting you will pick from a list of programming techniques
which are not yet on the syllabus. One week you will teach
the class for 30--40 minutes about the technique. Your lesson should
include an accompanying blog post with the necessary code and
instructions. (*[The Programming Historian][]* will be a helpful model;
you may eventually wish to submit your tutorial to the *Programming
Historian's* peer review.

### Course project and presentation

Over the course of the semester you will create some digital history
project using computer programming. (This project should be roughly the
equivalent of a seminar paper's worth of work.) This project should be
chosen in consultation with me. It might take any number of forms: a
library or plugin, a research paper backed by programming methods, a
visualization, etc. During the semester you will create a brief proposal
and set of specifications for the project. At our last class meeting you
will give an informal presentation where you explain both the code and
the historical argument to the class and get some feedback from them and
me. The finished project will be due a week later.
