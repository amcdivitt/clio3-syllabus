### Course description

This class will introduce you to the rudiments of programming languages;
even more, the class will teach you how to learn how to learn whatever
programming techniques you need to solve scholarly problems. We will
spend the first month on an general introduction to programming. Most of
the course will focus on applying programming techniques to historical
research. Each week you will learn a new technique---such as a
visualization, mapping, network analysis, text-mining---using real
historical data to develop arguments and interpretation. By the end of
the semester you will create a programming project of your choice which
will help you in your future scholarly research. The main languages that
you will learn are [JavaScript][] (a language obligatory for the web but
useful for many applications) and [R][] (a statistical programming
language well-suited to scholarly purposes), but you are encouraged to
learn any language you like for the final project.

### Learning goals

After taking this course, you will

-   be able to use computer programming to make historical arguments;
-   be able to apply programmatic techniques to scholarly research in
    history, especially involving data analysis;
-   understand the common concepts of computer programming across
    computer languages;
-   be able to use Javascript and R and some of their most useful
    libraries;
-   be able to read documentation for languages and libraries in order
    to teach yourself programming techniques as they become useful to
    you.

### How to succeed at this course

This course does not assume any prior experience with computer
programming. (However the course does assume that you have taken George
Mason's Clio 1 and Clio 2, and thus possess the skills taught in those
courses.) This course will be hard and unfamiliar, not least because you
will be learning new techniques at the same time that you are trying to
apply them to historical research. Here are a couple suggestions about
how to succeed at this course:

-   Come talk with me early and often. Once a week is not too often to
    talk outside of class. Most of your learning will happen outside of
    class, and I will be able to help you the most if you try your hand
    at the exercises before you come, but a conversation can go a long
    way towards getting you unstuck.

-   Keep the history in mind at all times, and especially think about
    how you might turn computer code into a historical argument. It is
    very difficult to learn to program without a genuine use for what
    you are trying to learn. Find a way that the techniques we are
    learning apply to your research, especially your work for a
    dissertation, research paper, or job. I will provide data sets that
    you can use, but you are always welcome to substitute sources that
    are relevant to your research.

### A few notes

This course assumes that you are programming in a Unix-like environment,
namely some Linux distribution running natively or in a virtual machine,
or in the Unix underpinnings of Mac OS X. You're free to use Windows if
you like, but I won't be able to guide you in figuring out the
differences, and your code will have to run on my machine. Configuration
is the bane of all computer projects, and to that end all code must run
on a standard machine. This machine image will be available to you using
[Vagrant][], and you'll be able to run it as a virtual machine on your
own computer. You should test all non-trivial code in the virtual
machine before submitting it. We'll cover this in an early class period.

The culture around programming can be extraordinarily generous, with
many people sharing their work and expertise for free. It can also be
extraordinarily toxic, especially for women and minorities. Part of this
course will be learning to help yourself in the culture of programming,
including indispensable sites such as [Stack Overflow][]. If you get
stuck in the more nefarious parts of the culture, come ask for help.
[This website][] from the UVA Speaking in Code summit might help too.
