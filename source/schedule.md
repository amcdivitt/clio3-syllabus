## Aug. 27: Unix as a Way of Life

### Goal

This week you will learn to interact with your computer and to run
programs through the command-line interface. You will also learn a
philosophy for writing programs.

### Reading

-   Mike Gancarz, *[Linux and the Unix Philosophy][]*, chs. 1--8,
    focusing on the ten tenets.
-   William E. Shotts Jr., *[The Linux Command Line: A Complete
    Introduction][]*. Most of this book is a reference source, but
    familiarize yourself at a minimum with chapters 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11.
    Nearly all of this will apply to the terminal in Mac OS X.

### Exercises

As you read Shotts, try out all the Unix style commands in your
terminal. You should be prepared to navigate the file system and run
commands through the shell.

Before class, do your best to get the following installed:

-   A text editor of your choice: [Sublime Text][], [TextWrangler][],
    [Atom][], and [Vim][] are all solid choices.
-   [Google Chrome][]
-   [VirtualBox][]
-   [Vagrant][]
-   [Homebrew][] if you're on a Mac
-   [Git][] (through Homebrew on a Mac)
-   [Node.js][] (through Homebrew on a Mac)
-   [R language][]
-   [R Studio Desktop][]

If you are on a Mac, you should install [Homebrew][] and any necessary
dependencies as you go along. If you are on some kind of Linux machine,
then probably everything you need is in your package manager. If you are
on a Windows PC, you should install [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS][] inside Virtual
Box using [Vagrant][].

## Sept. 3: Version Control and Reproducible Research

### Goal

Learning version control will let you contribute to projects and
distribute your code, and most importantly reproduce your own results.
(We will end class with an introduction to JavaScript.)

### Reading

-   [Basic Git][].
-   [Documentation for GitHub][] and [their tutorials][].
-   Look at Scott Chacon, *[Pro Git][]*, especially chs. 1--3, 5, for
    reference.
-   Read Karl Broman's [lectures about reproducible research][]:
    [introduction][]; [command line][]; [version control][].

### Exercises

-   Work through [GitHub's online, interactive tutorial][] for Git.
-   Sign up for [GitHub][].
-   At least one day before class, submit a pull request (or as many as
    you need to) to the [repository for this syllabus][]. The pull
    request should modify the list of participants to add your name with
    a link to your personal website, as well as your GitHub username and
    a link to your GitHub user profile. Feel free to include your
    Twitter username and link if you like. (A guide to [Markdown][] if
    you need it.) Also add your name and topics for the language report
    and the additional techniques report.

    1-4.
-   Read Hadley Wickham, ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis
-   Be aware of Wilkinson, Grammar of Graphics
-   Tutorials in bookmarks on R base graphics
-   Familiarize yourself with the [ggplot2 documentation][].
-   If you're feeling ambitious, check out ggvis.

### Exercises

-   Experiment with ggplot2 in R Studio.
-   Work your way through {TODO} sample data sets. What charts can you
    create? Post your results to rpubs and add a link as a pull request
    a couple hours before class.
